            <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2">
              <p>This is where it all began. Like many people, I was exposed to HTML in school. Perhaps the difference is that my education was in Audio Engineering.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p>This gave me a unique perspective, because from the get-go the reason for making a site was to market yourself and your business with no creative limitations.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">
              <p>The Alley is where I learned to communicate and execute a designers vision. As the front of house operator, my job was to listen to what the designers want and make sure it was properly executed. The difficult part was, you can't see sound! So, communication was key.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-5">
              <p>More importantly, this is where I was first exposed to PHP and CSS. Anyone ever sat through a regional theater tech rehearsal? Well, there's a lot of downtime! So, I fired up my computer and started hacking away. I got my first paid PHP gig in 2006.</p></a></p>

            <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2">
              <p>This is where I really cut my teeth in the world of digital agencies. Focused mainly on mobile apps and their supporting websites, I was a technical project manager in charge of herding the cats and making sure the client was getting what they wanted.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p>This is also where I met <a href="http://modx.com/" target="_blank">MODX</a> thanks to Kelsey Ruger. It was the year the MODX Revolution Beta was released and I was all over it. Goodbye Wordpress and Joomla, there's a new CMS in town! While I still work with any CMS, this is by far my favorite.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">
              <p>I started as the Web Director in a division of one and quickly moved to the VP Interactive with a four member team and a network of contractors. I was able to channel the communication skills I had honed between designers, developers and clients to help achieve the company's goals.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-5">
              <p>Over my four years with the company I was able to raise the interactive division's profitability and create a team of developers and designers that could work in harmony to execute the clients vision. My design focus was always on creating a smooth user experience that lead users to the business owner's goals.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-2">
              <p>If you can do it for someone else, you can do it for yourself. After years in the industry, my wife and I decided to make a move to Colorado and open our own company. Now, I focus on working with the network of designers, marketers and other developers I've gained over time to build great websites.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
              <p>While I am usually working as the development talent for other agencies, I also run projects with teams of other creatives. So, whether you're an agency or a business owner, I know how to smoothly integrate into your project to make it the best it can be.</p>
